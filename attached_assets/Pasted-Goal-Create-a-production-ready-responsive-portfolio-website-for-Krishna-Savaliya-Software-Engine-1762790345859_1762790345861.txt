Goal
Create a production-ready, responsive portfolio website for "Krishna Savaliya" (Software Engineer). Build it with React (Vite or Create React App) + Tailwind CSS.

Provide all source files, a README with deployment steps for Replit, and a downloadable resume (PDF link).

Pages / Sections (single-page with nav + separate route pages allowed)
1. Home (hero)
  - Big headline: "Krishna Savaliya — Open edX / Django Developer"
  - Short tagline: "Open edX specialist with 4 years experience — themes, custom reports, ecommerce & integrations"

  - Social links: GitHub, GitLab, LinkedIn, email.
  - Small map or location text (Ahmedabad, India).

UI / UX Requirements

- Responsive layout that looks great on mobile and desktop.
- Use a modern font (Google Fonts) and include accessible color contrast.
- Include SEO meta tags (title, description) + Open Graph tags and a placeholder OG image.
- Provide favicon and default profile image placeholder.

Functionality / Code Quality

- Use React Router (optional) for separate pages or smooth scroll anchors.
- Form validation (basic) and success/failure UI for contact form.
- Provide sample JSON data file for projects (so user can edit projects without touching components).
- Include unit test examples for one small component (Jest + React Testing Library) — optional but preferred.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt attributes, keyboard navigation for modals.

Generate
